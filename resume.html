<p>I’m a proud Saigonese who grew up in a city of tremendous hustle and fabulous food. That experience has made
me both an ambitious learner in Interactive Design and a culinary adventurer. Persistence is my greatest strength; it makes me reliable and confident in my ability to grow as a person and a creative collaborator. Fast-paced, high-pressure environments, like the city I grew up in, bring out the best in me. My current goal is to get an internship position for summer 2023 in order to gain valuable hands-on experience.</p>
